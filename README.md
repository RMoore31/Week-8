# Week-8

This program defines a simple BankAccount class that tracks a user's balance and allows deposits and purchases. Each transaction updates the balance and is written to a file called transactions.txt. In main, the program creates an account, performs one deposit and two purchases, and then displays the final balance. Finally, it informs the user that all transactions have been saved to the file.
